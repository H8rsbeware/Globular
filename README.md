# Globular

A GeoChron-like project, that attempts to bring similar versions of the clock as desktop wallpapers or just to watch. 
Written in C# - first time but need to learn it - so only supports windows for the time-being, atleast for wallpapers.

Attempting to write without any wifi connectivity for most versions of the map, however having it as an option might be a choice later.
